# TerraLiveDemo

Build a docker container for Terra/AnVIL workshop. Reference Sean Davis's GitHub
template, [BuildABiocWorkshop](https://github.com/seandavi/BuildABiocWorkshop).
Base image is from [Terra Jupyter Notebook base images](https://github.com/databiosphere/terra-docker#terra-base-images).

First, run the vignette, `HowToUse`. This will install some GitHub packages and
download data files for the analysis. Once it's done, you can try all the 
analysis under `GenomicSuperSignaturePaper/Results`.
